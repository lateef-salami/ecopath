teaser: At Ecopath we are developing a circular economy for photocopier, printer and duplicator cartridges in Nigeria. Our mission is to provide affordable and eco-friendly ink and toner cartridges to advance industries with high demand for printouts (education, healthcare, etc.) while also reducing the amount of plastic waste generated.

### The problem

Thousands of ink and toner cartridges are imported into Nigeria every year for use in education, healthcare, finance and other sectors. 
Since no cartridges are manufactured in Nigeria, the quality of those available for purchase is determined by the foreign exchange conditions. 
The value of naira (NGN) against the US dollar (USD) has fallen fourfold since 2008, pushing the importers to purchase the cheapest options - often these are low quality cartridges from China that contain inks and toners hazardous to human health.

Two options are available on the market - products from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible products.
OEM products are of high quality and produce high yields, but they are expensive. 
Compatible products, usually from China, are more affordable, but their quality is inconsistent, their yields are lower and they sometimes include toxic components.
In both cases, once the cartridges are empty, they are disposed of together with the rest of unsorted waste, causing a detrimental impact on the environment.


### Our solution

Our solution is to create a circular economy for ink and toner cartridges in Nigeria. Our key activities are: 
1. Retrieving used cartridges through buy back schemes and other incentives.
2. Remanufacturing used cartridges using imported machinery and components. 
Used cartridges are cleaned, refilled with ink/toner, refitted with a new ink/toner sensor, and repackaged to be sold under our brand name. 
3. Selling cartridges through our strategic partners covering all 36 states in Nigeria. 
Our products do not add to the waste management burden on our clients, as we offer incentives and buy back schemes to retrieve used cartridges for remanufacturing.

Our unique selling proposition:
1. **Lowest price** as our production costs are low - we use recovered empty cartridges (that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated), import all components in bulk and outsource packaging production to a local company. 
Price is often the most important factor driving cartridge purchasing decisions in Nigeria.
2. **Best quality** as we use reusable OEM components and imported components from high quality manufacturers.
In Nigeria, locally made products are often perceived as inferior to imported products.
We will dispel this perception by providing samples. 
Additionally, the fact that we import our ink from Japan, a country that is believed to produce the best quality raw materials and products, will boost customer confidence.
2. **Non-toxic** inks and toners as we chose our suppliers with care.
We will import ink from [Wako][2], our partners in Japan, who use soya oil in manufacturing instead of petrochemicals. 
Their ink samples are analysed in specialised laboratories to test for toxicity; a laboratory-issued certificate verifying the safety of the product is attached to every shipment.
We will make copies of these certificates available to our customers, to compete with other compatible products that are usually not tested for toxicity to avoid extra costs.
4. **Zero waste to landfill** as we recover our cartridges from our customers to either remanufacture or recycle them with our local partner [Wecyclers][1]. According to our partners in Japan, the same cartridge can be remanufactured 5 times before the quality starts to decline. Our packaging will be plastic free.

Additionally, we will be making a difference by:
<ol start="5">
	<li>
		<b>Building an inclusive and diverse team.</b>
		We will aim to have an equal number of male and female employees, and we will reserve 30% of our vacancies for people with disabilities.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Supporting local charities and educational institutions.</b>
		We will donate an equivalent of USD 1 for every cartridge we sell. 
		We want to support tertiary educational institutions to strengthen their research capacity and fund students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and Diabetic Association of Nigeria as diabetes rates are surging in Nigeria and many cannot afford the treatment they need.
	</li>
</ol>


### Our target market

Currently our main target markets are tertiary educational institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that specialise in cartridge sales.
In the future, we will expand to primary and secondary schools, healthcare institutions, financial institutions, manufacturing businesses, packaging producers, supermarkets and other retailers, tourism industry, consultancies, etc.
