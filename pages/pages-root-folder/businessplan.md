### <a name="problem"></a> The problem

Thousands of ink and toner cartridges are imported into Nigeria every year for use in education, healthcare, finance and other sectors. 
Since no cartridges are manufactured in Nigeria, the quality of those available for purchase is determined by the foreign exchange conditions. 
The value of naira (NGN) against the US dollar (USD) has fallen fourfold since 2008, pushing the importers to purchase the cheapest options - often these are low quality cartridges from China that contain inks and toners hazardous to human health.

Two options are available on the market - products from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and compatible products.
OEM products are of high quality and produce high yields, but they are expensive. 
Compatible products, usually from China, are more affordable, but their quality is inconsistent, their yields are lower and they sometimes include toxic components.
In both cases, once the cartridges are empty, they are disposed of together with the rest of unsorted waste, causing a detrimental impact on the environment.


### <a name="solution"></a> Our solution

Our solution is to create a circular economy for ink and toner cartridges in Nigeria. Our key activities are: 
1. Retrieving used cartridges through buy back schemes and other incentives.
2. Remanufacturing used cartridges using imported machinery and components. 
Used cartridges are cleaned, refilled with ink/toner, refitted with a new ink/toner sensor, and repackaged to be sold under our brand name. 
3. Selling cartridges through our regional sales managers covering all 36 states in Nigeria. 
Our products do not add to the waste management burden on our clients, as we offer incentives and buy back schemes to retrieve used cartridges for remanufacturing.

Our unique selling proposition:
1. **Lowest price** as our production costs are low - we use recovered empty cartridges (that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated), import all components in bulk and outsource packaging production to a local company. 
Price is often the most important factor driving cartridge purchasing decisions in Nigeria.
2. **Best quality** as we use reusable OEM components and imported components from high quality manufacturers.
In Nigeria, locally made products are often perceived as inferior to imported products.
We will dispel this perception by providing samples. 
Additionally, the fact that we import our ink from Japan, a country that is believed to produce the best quality raw materials and products, will boost customer confidence.
2. **Non-toxic** inks and toners as we chose our suppliers with care.
We will import ink from [Wako][2], our partners in Japan, who use soya oil in manufacturing instead of petrochemicals. 
Their ink samples are analysed in specialised laboratories to test for toxicity; a laboratory-issued certificate verifying the safety of the product is attached to every shipment.
We will make copies of these certificates available to our customers, to compete with other compatible products that are usually not tested for toxicity to avoid extra costs.
4. **Zero waste to landfill** as we recover our cartridges from our customers to either remanufacture or recycle them with our local partner [Wecyclers][1]. According to our partners in Japan, the same cartridge can be remanufactured 5 times before the quality starts to decline. Our packaging will be plastic free.

Additionally, we will be making a difference by:
<ol start="5">
	<li>
		<b>Building an inclusive and diverse team.</b>
		We will aim to have an equal number of male and female employees, and we will reserve 30% of our vacancies for people with disabilities.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Supporting local charities and educational institutions.</b>
		We will donate an equivalent of USD 1 for every cartridge we sell. 
		We want to support tertiary educational institutions to strengthen their research capacity and fund students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and Diabetic Association of Nigeria as diabetes rates are surging in Nigeria and many cannot afford the treatment they need.
	</li>
</ol>


### <a name="market"></a> Our target markets

Currently our main target markets are tertiary educational institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that specialise in cartridge sales.
In the future, we will expand to primary and secondary schools, healthcare institutions, financial institutions, manufacturing businesses, packaging producers, supermarkets and other retailers, tourism industry, consultancies, etc.


##### Tertiary educational institutions

Tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria include universities, polytechnics, monotechnics and specialized institutions, colleges of agriculture, health technology and education, vocational, innovations and technical colleges.
Almost all educational activities in these institutions are paper based - curricula, study materials, lecture handouts and exam papers sall have to be printed for each student.
During the pandemic online learning was trialed with disastrous results, showing that with the present day infrastructure learning has to remain paper based.

Tertiary educational institutions use duplicators for high volume printing, as they provide speed (up to 1000 copies per minute) and cost efficiency that cannot be matched by printers or photocopiers. 
Ink cartridges for duplicators are easy to clean, refill and refit with a new ink sensor.

Advantages of focussing on tertiary educational institutions:
1. It is a **large market**.
There are 2 million students in 174 universities in Nigeria and many more in 564 other tertiary educational institutions.
The sector is on a rapid growth trajectory, with new institutions opening every year, and for a good reason.
Nigeria is is a young country with [43.5% of population under the age of 14][3] - that is more than 87 million young people that will be looking for education.
The literacy rate is 75% among people aged 15 to 24.
Tertiary educational institutions are present throughout the country - about 45% of them are in capital cities of the states, 35% in other major towns, and 20% in remote towns and rural areas.
They are not tied into long-term contracts with their cartridge suppliers. 
Some of them have maintenance contracts with SMEs that also supply cartridges to them, but the market is open and it is common to change suppliers based on the price they can offer.
2. It is **easy to reach** this market.
Over 170 universities and colleges are memebrs of the [Committee of Vice-Chancelors (CVC)][5]. 
Over 300 polytechnics, colleges of agriculture and other technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions are under the management of [National Board of Technical Education (NBTE)][6].
This means that we can access 64% of tertiary educational institutions simply by reaching out to CVC and NBTE.
Our ink cartridges for duplicators are already being tested by CVC and they are very pleased with the high quality of our product.
In the future we will also reach out to [National Universities Commission (NUC)][7], an umbrella body for all universities, and [Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU)][8].
In contrast, Nigeria's primary schools are administered by the local governments and hence the market is much more fragmented.
But it is a big market - there are about 97,000 primary schools (64% of them are public) and about 33,000 secondary schools (38% of them are public) - and we will be targeting this market in the future.
3. **Price is often the deciding factor** for tertiary educational institutions, especially since present day economic challenges have lead to decrease in government budget for educational sector.
Out of 738 institutions, 169 are federal government owned and 324 are state government owned.
Since our production costs are low, we are able to offer the best price on the market while our products are also high quality and eco friendly.
4. The market is active **all year round**, since the calendar of tertiary educational institutions in Nigeria is not unified. 
This means that out of 738 institutions about 600 have ongoing academic activities in any given month.
The demand peaks during the fourth month of every semester due to exams.

##### SMEs specialising in cartridge sales

Duplicator ink cartridge market in Nigeria is dominated by SMEs that operate by establishing close relationships with end users.
Small-scale businesses with largely informal operations are the most common providers of maintenance and repairs for duplicators, and they also supply the ink cartridges. 
These often consist of a sole proprietor and a couple of apprentices.
Medium-scale businesses are much less numerous compared to small-scale businesses. 
Their operations are more formalised, and they usually employ 1-6 staff members.

Vast majority of SMEs do not import the ink cartridges directly, instead they rely on OEM franchises and large-scale importers of compatible products. 
The deciding factors for them are both price (to improve their profit margins) and quality as most of them also provide repair services.
Poor quality cartridges and inks lead to increased need for repairs, which results in damage to reputation and loss of customers.

Through our regional sales managers covering all states in Nigeria, we will form a strong bond with these SMEs.
About 90% of these SMEs are located in capital cities of the states, and SMEs within the same city usually all know each other and sometimes operate informal trade associations. 
This means that we will be able to quickly grow our market share through referrals as much as through approaching SMEs directly.

### <a name="reach"></a> How will we reach our customers

Our regional sales managers will have close relationships with our existing and prospective customers in different parts of the country. 
This will be achieved through five main channels:
1. Currently **in person communication** is still the prevalent method to reach customers in this industry. 
To reach SMEs we will organise in person meetings, and network at events for stakeholders in office equipment industry.
To reach tertiary educational institutions we will scheduled product demonstrations with officials in charge of procurement, and network through umbrella bodies like [NUC][7], [ASUU][8], [CVC][5] and [NBTE][6].
2. **Social media** platforms - WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter - that are popular in Nigeria.
Through advertisement on social media platforms, and through our website and LinkedIn page we are able to reach a large segment of the market.
This will also often be the main channel for communicating with our SME customers, since they are active on social media platforms both because it allows them to reach their customers and because it fits their highly mobile lifestyle - they spend more time visiting their customers to provide maintenance and repair services than in their offices.
3. **Direct mail marketing** will be used to reach officials in charge of procurement in tertiary educational institutions that cannot be reached otherwise. 
Physical mail delivered to educational institutions gets prompt attention, while marketing emails get lost in junk mail. 
4. **Bluesky** platform of existing links and networks among SMEs.
5. **Referrals** will also play an important role.
We will offer 2-5% bonus to SMEs whose referred customers buy our products.
To increase our market share among tertiary educational institutions we will provide references supplied by other institutions already using our products.
